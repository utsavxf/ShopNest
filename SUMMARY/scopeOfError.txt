Bhai in react for displaying images always import them and then in src={}

server side routing me always use a return statement while using response

for checking status in client side use ===

.env file me kuch bhi change nahi karna hai,samjha jaisa hai vaise hi rehne diyo, even one small extra comma will give u error 

whenver you are either saving data into mongodb or deleting it ,don't forget to use await
